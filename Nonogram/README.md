Validator.py is not my code, it was shared by teacher with me to validate my solutions.

To run NonogramSolver.cpp on test cases, write following lines in terminal:\
g++ NonogramSolver.cpp -o NonogramSolver \
python validator.py zad1 ./NonogramSolver \
python validator.py zad2 ./NonogramSolver

All testcases are included in validator.py
